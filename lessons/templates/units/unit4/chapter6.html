A Set is a list and has all of its properties but no duplicate elements. Python's set class represents the mathematical notion of a set

A set is created by using curly braces and its elements are sorted by a ,
<pre class="code-area">
nums = {1,2,3,4,5}
</pre>
The set function can also be uswd to create a set It takes an arbitary number of arguments and return a set
No parameters are passed to create the empty set
Note in order to create an empty set use the <i>set()</i> function instead of using open-close curly braces since it creates an empty dictionary

<b>Set Functions</b>
add()		Adds an element to the set
clear()	Removes all elements from the set
copy()		Returns a copy of the set
remove()	Removes an element from the set for the given id
discard()	Removes an element from the set if it is a member. (Do nothing if the element is not in set)
pop()		Removes and returns an arbitary set element. Raise KeyError if the set is empty

<b>Set Mathematical Functions</b>
difference()	Returns the difference of two or more sets as a new set
difference_update()	Removes all elements of another set from this set
intersection()	Returns the intersection of two sets as a new set
intersection_update()	Updates the set with the intersection of itself and another
isdisjoint()	Returns True if two sets have a null intersection
issubset()	Returns True if another set contains this set
issuperset()	Returns True if this set contains another set

symmetric_difference()	Returns the symmetric difference of two sets as a new set
symmetric_difference_update()	Updates a set with the symmetric difference of itself and another
union()	Returns the union of sets in a new set
update()	Updates the set with the union of itself and others
