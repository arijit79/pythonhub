A function can be reassigned to another variable. This is done in the same way as you do with other data types except it is passed without any argument, for example
<pre class="code-area">
def add_num(a, b):
    print(a + b)

an = add_num
an(2, 5)

# Result
7
</pre>
So as you can see that we assigned the name of a function to something else. This is going to be helpful as move to the future lessons
