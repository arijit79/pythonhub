Now that you have understood what a software is, we now shall lokk at how a software is built. A software is built by an organisation or a company to be used by computers all over the world. Software is built by writing it. Developers write it in a special language called Programming Language. This is mostly English but it does not follows any laws of English. They save it into files which are then translated into binary as computers can only understand the binary language by a special software called compiler or sometimes in a interpreter depending on the type of programming language which will be discussed later in the unit. After its converted to binary it is then converted to a <i>.exe</i> file used by Windows OS or a <i>.dmg</i> file for Mac OS. For Linux, it can handle the program on its own. After a change to desired executable, it is then sent for the public to be used. During development, a thorough testing of the software is done before it is changed to a executable.
The developers also write some manuals and guides for the software to make new users learn it easily.
