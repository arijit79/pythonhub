Now let's talk about the <i>range()</i> function, that we touched earlier. The range function takes a start and end value and returns a object that cna be iterated over to get numbers between the given range. For example to get numbers from 0 to 3, we will do something like this
<pre class="code-area">
for i in range(4):
    print(i)

# Result
0
1
2
3
</pre>
<b>Note: 4 is not included by the <i>range()</i> function and it only counts upto 3</b> <br>
You can give the range function a start value by putting it before the end value
<pre class="code-area">
for i in range(1,4):
    print(i)

# Result
1
2
3
</pre>
You can give <i>range()</i> a step value, what it will do is instead of incrementing by 1, it will increment by your wish. You can add it by putting it after the end value
<pre class="code-area">
for i in range(1, 11, 2):
    print(i)

# Result
1
3
5
7
9
</pre>
The <i>range()</i> function can not only increment but also decrement depending on the step value, for example to do a backward counting from 10 to 0, we can use a -1 and reversig the start value and end value
<pre class="code-area">
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(i)

# Result
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
</pre>
So it did as expected. You can also put -2 for a step of -2. So tat's a look at range function in Python. It is very useful function in Python for any kind of getting numbers in a range
