In Python, we have two types of loops while loops, which we discussed earlier and for loops. A <i>for</i> loop takes an iterable and gets a iterator from the iterable which it then runs a <i>next()</i> function to get the next value. We will discuss iterables and iterators in the upcoming chapters but now let's make a for loop. For loop uses the following syntax
<pre class="code-area">
for ITERATOR in ITERABLE:
    statements...
</pre>
Just consider ITERATOR as just a variable for now that we can loop over. Let's make a for loop to print numbers between 0 to 5
<pre class="code-area">
for i in range(6):
    print(i)

# Result
0
1
2
3
4
5
</pre>
So as you can see it printed numbers from 0 to 5. You might be thinking what is that <i>range()</i> function. It is a generator built into Python that returns numbers from a given range. We said it to print numbers between 0 and 5. Note that e gave an argument of 6 to the <i>range()</i> function since it does not include 6. Also we did'nt said a start so it by default started from 0. Now toy also might be thinking what that <i>i</i> is, it is the iterator that we are talking about. In the next line we just printed the current value of <i>i</i>. Now let's talk about two statements that are used in loop control, that are <i>break</i> and <i>continue</i>, they can be used in any loop, let's see what they do
<ul>
    <li>The break statement breaks a loop without getting the loop complete. For example</li>
    <pre class="code-area">
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
    if i == 2:
        break

# Result
1
2
    </pre>
    So as you can see that it stopped the loop before completion
    <li>The continue statement</li> helps to skip the current iteration and move to the next
    <pre class="code-area">
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)

# Result
1
3
4
5
    </pre>
    So it skipped 2 as we said in the conditional that if i is equal to 2 then don't do anything but move to the next iteration of the loop
</ul>

So we just learned <i>for</i> loops, we will discuss in the future chapters about how to iterate over lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries with for loops but for the next chapter you will learn about the <i>range()</i> function
